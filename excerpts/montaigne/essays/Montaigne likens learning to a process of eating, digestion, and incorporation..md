> It is a sign of rawness and indigestion to disgorge food just as we swallowed it. The stomach has not done its work if it has not changed the condition and form of what has been given it to cook.

> We labor only to fill our memory, and leave the understanding and the conscience empty. Just as birds sometimes go in quest of grain, and carry it in their beak without tasting it to give a beakful to their little ones, so our pedants go pillaging knowledge in books and lodge it only on the end of their lips, in order merely to disgorge it and scatter it to the winds.

> I go about cadging from books here and there the sayings that please me, not to keep them, for I have no storehouses, but to transport them into this one [his *Essays*], in which, to tell the truth, they are no more mine than in their original place.” 

> Dionysius used to make fun of the grammarians who are at pains to inquire about the troubles of Ulysses and are ignorant of their own; the musicians who tune their flutes and do not tune their morals; the orators who study to talk justice, not to do it. If our soul does not go at a better gait, if we do not have sounder judgment for all our learning, I had just as well my student had spent his time playing tennis: at least his body would be the fitter. See him come back from there, after fifteen or sixteen years put in: there is nothing so unfit for use. All the advantage you recognize is that his Latin and Greek have made him more conceited and arrogant than when he left home. He should have brought back his soul full; he brings it back only swollen; he has only inflated it instead of enlarging it. 

His writing is a sort of prosthetic belly. By his own account, he sponges off the learning of others without  incorporation.
