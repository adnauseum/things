# Things.

How can you have a system without having some idea of the end-goal? Passing a class, learning a language, building a blog, and writing a book yield different systems.

Take care for the structure more than manufacturing ideas or outcomes.

## Collecting things.

- Collect disorganized thoughts, conversations, half-baked ideas, poorly phrased questions, and everything else in notebooks (paper/digital).
- This probably comes in proportion to how much we look at "the big picture" and try to connect something to another thing.
- These tools have to be in service to our goal.
- This is the first filter between the world and your senses.
- It's filterfeeding. Most of what you catch is garbage.
- Use whatever collection tools you like: phone, notebooks, voice recordings, whatever.
  - I like making lists for no reason.
  - This probably irks people.

## Processing the collected things.

- Imagine you have a weekly 1:1 with a colleague.
- You can keep follow-ups, questions, and updates in a 1:1 in a notebook.
- Not every idea in the notebook is worthy of keeping forever, but it's probably worth a skim since it compelled you enough to crystalize it to writing.
- The notebook doesn't matter as much as the pre-meeting routine you have before you meet for your 1:1.
- This routine nudges you to go through the notebook and think about what's in it.
- Maybe there's a similar routine we should have with the things we've collected.
- Routiunely go through these notes, voice memos, texts to self, saved articles, whatever.
- You can pull those out into yet another note and see if they're just as important next session.
- You can retrospectively pull out ideas, questions, references out of them.
- Expect that the majority of content is worthless.
- Maybe you have a biweekly or triweekly routine of going through your notebook for 10-15 minutes. Start small.
- Keeping this routine seems like one of those unsubstitutable labors that make the whole system work. Try to make it as fun as possible.
  - Pull ideas out of your notes.
  - Annotate your notes with ideas you get retrospectively.
  - If anything's really good, transfer them to your persistence queue.

## Tags

Think of tags as hooks to aggregate notes together and the double bracket links as bridges to related information.

```
Meta tags (tags about the notes themselves, relative to the note taking system):
